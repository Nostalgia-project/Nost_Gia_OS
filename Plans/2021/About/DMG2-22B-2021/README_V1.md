# About project (February 22nd 2021)

I have been experimenting with Nostalgia on a daily basis since my Windows fan phase that started in 2015. Recent develops in 2020 and onward have led me to find that I can actually trick the mind into believing you have gone back in time under certain circumstances. This seems like something from Science Fiction, and right now, it is, as I am not able to fully take someone back.

Today, I am furthering the project. Based on research from my nostalgia project, the most common things that can be used to take you back are coldness, clouds, snow, certain smells, certain shades of red, certain instrumental tones, and mist from spring. I am merging parts of the compuNose project to help aid this experiment.

My plans for the device are currently in 2 decisions:

1. A headset that uses various technologies to take you back

2. A portable small room with a chair that uses technologies and isolates you into the past. The room will be small enough to only take up 1.5 seats in a car or truck, but will completely isolate you

I am considering doing both models, as they both have their own pros and cons.
